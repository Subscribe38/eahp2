emergency ambulance hiring system enables patients to book ambulance in emergency from any part of india.
In todayâ€™s world and in India, due to rapid growth in population and increase in traffic accidents are bound to often as the clock runs around. our goal is to design website to assist the needed patience with medical care. 
1.2 Need for system:
The motto of the design is to bridge time line between the ambulance arrival and the call made by the patient.. Due to the heavy traffic, the ambulance driver initially had no idea of the precise location of the accident scene. As a result, we were not able to save many lives. Since everything in the world today runs on smartphones and apps, we have developed a website that allows real-timemonitoring of ambulance services.
